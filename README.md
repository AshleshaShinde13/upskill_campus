The problem is to design and implement a URL shortener service. URL shorteners are tools used to convert long URLs into shorter and more manageable links that redirect to the original, longer URL when clicked. These shortened URLs are particularly useful in situations where character limits exist, such as in social media posts, and they also make links more visually appealing. Given a long URL, the service should generate a shorter and unique alias or key for it. This shortened URL should ideally be much shorter than the original one.  When a user accesses the shortened URL, they should be redirected to the original long URL associated with that alias. Overall, the goal of the URL shortener is to simplify and optimize the process of sharing and accessing long URLs, making them more user-friendly and convenient.
